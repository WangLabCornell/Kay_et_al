Unzipping
1. plot_Unzipping_Force_Sliding.m
Script to load the data including time, force, extension, and step number from optical tweezers instruement for Pol II collision with the DNA unzipping fork described in Figure 1. Give statistics for trasncribed distance, force dispalcement, and sliding distance

2. plot_Unzipping_RNA-DNA Hybrid.m
Script to load the data including time, force, extension, and step number from optical tweezers instruement for Pol II collision with the DNA unzipping fork described in Figure 1 and 2.  Give statisitics for transcribed distance, Pol II location, and RNA-DNA hybrid size

3. plot_Unzipping_Backtrack.m
Script to load the data including time, force, extension, and step number from optical tweezers instruement for Pol II collision with the DNA unzipping fork with Pol II backtracking step described in Figure 3 and 4. Plots each tasks and give statistics for transcribed distance, backtrack distance, and ability/inability to rezip

4. plot_Unzipping_Replication.m
Script to load the data including time, force, extension, and step number from optical tweezers instruement for Pol II collision with the DNA unzipping fork with Pol II backtracking and DNAP extension step described in Figure 5. Plots each task and give statistics for transcribed distance, backtrack distance, ability/inability to rezip, DNAP replciation and conversion from extension in nm to bp replicated.

5. importtheory.m
Function for loading unzipping theory data file.
